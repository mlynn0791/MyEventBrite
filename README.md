# MyEventBrite

This was a group project and is a full stack web application created to be an “alike” version of the popular website EventBrite, which is an event management and ticketing website. Within this React based application, end users can select from the events stored within the MongoDB database and purchase tickets using their method of payment and can even use PayPal as a checkout option. This application was created using the programming languages JavaScript, HTML, & CSS and deployed using Heroku. 

Within this group project, I contributed to the commits that can be found here at the original project repository:
